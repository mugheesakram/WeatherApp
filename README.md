# Introduction!

Hi! I am **Mughees Akram**. I am an android developer with around 5 years of
experience in Android Development. Here is my take on the assignment that you gave me to showcase my
skills and knowledge.

# Tech Stack

Here is the tech stack that i have used to in this project:

- MVVM
- Clean Architecture
- Jetpack Compose
- Repository Pattern
- Retrofit
- Room Database
- Coroutines.
- LiveData
- Compose Navigation
- Location Service
- Hilt for Dependency Injection.
- Mockk
- Junit
- Testing Extensions
- Multi flavor / Multiple environments handling.

## Assumptions

Here are few assumptions that i made in the course of implementing this :

- For UI, I have used Jetpack Compose just to let you know that I have pretty good grip on it.
- This assignment is following almost well form of clean architecture.
- I have implemented repository pattern so that our domain layer i.e ViewModel doesn't know from where it is getting data from. It only just know one source of truth.
- I have also implemented **Unit Test** of ViewModels and Data Repository.
- Unfortunately, i couldn't invest enough time to Implement settings screens and make this project multi modular. These both things were not tough but I needed more time. I also was not able to Test UI.
- For searching location, i am using GeoLocation API of OpenWeatherMap.
